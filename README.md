Code to replicate "An Empirical Evaluation of the Performance of Financial Protection Indicators:  Evidence from Burkina Faso"
Data comes from the EnquÃªte Multisectorielle Continue 2014 (EMC 2014), part of the LSMS-ISA surveys.
The raw data can be obtained in the World's Bank microdata catalogue at the following link: http://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/2538

The code for replication will be divided in two "steps"
  1. Generation of consumption estimates from raw data, and pulling household characteristics.
  2. Tables & Figures used in the paper.
